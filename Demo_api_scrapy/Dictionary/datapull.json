If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute\r\n  2. Ensure that you have created an issue on the Hive project JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HIVE/summary\r\n  3. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: \r\n  4. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP]HIVE-XXXXX:  Your PR title ...'.\r\n  5. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  6. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  7. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen running CTAS Iceberg already maintains a lock on the target table. Since [HIVE-26244] (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-26244) introduced a new locking mechanism for CTAS queries on any table, the two are clashing, resulting in deadlock.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDeadlock when running iceberg CTAS.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description, screenshot and/or a reproducable example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Hive versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual test\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n",

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute\r\n  2. Ensure that you have created an issue on the Hive project JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HIVE/summary\r\n  3. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: \r\n  4. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP]HIVE-XXXXX:  Your PR title ...'.\r\n  5. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  6. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  7. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nentity.getType() returns the value as  \"PARTITION\" for partitioned tables instead of \"TABLE\" as a result the above check returns false and the tablesWritten field in the hiveProtologger is left unpopulated for partitioned tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description, screenshot and/or a reproducable example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Hive versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit Test and manual test.",

        "body": "BPWrapper is used in LRFU cache eviction policy to decrease the time spent waiting for lock on the heap. This is done by adding a buffer as threadlocal and accumulating CacheableBuffer instances there before trying to acquire a lock. This works well when we have threads from pools such as IO-Elevator threads or OrcEncode threads.\r\n\r\nFor ephemeral threads there's no advantage of doing this as the buffers in threadlocals may never reach the heap or list structures of LRFU, thereby also making evictions less efficient. This can happen e.g. LLAPCacheAwareFS is used with Parquet, where we're using the Tez threads for both execution and IO.\r\n\r\nWe should disable BPWrappers for such cases.",

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute\r\n  2. Ensure that you have created an issue on the Hive project JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HIVE/summary\r\n  3. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: \r\n  4. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP]HIVE-XXXXX:  Your PR title ...'.\r\n  5. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  6. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  7. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIntroduce a property to skip SSL cert verification for downloading JWKS in HS2\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe usually used a self-signed certificate for a token generation service in testing/staging environment and this kind of certificates is not accepted in JVM. To ease the need of testing, we can use this property to turn off certificate verification for testing purpose.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description, screenshot and/or a reproducable example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Hive versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, users can turn off certificate verification for testing JWT authentication.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManually tested",

Introduce new API `DatabaseAccessor#getColumnTypes` to: i) allow fetching column types from the database; ii) align with the code using `DatabaseAccessor#getColumnNames`.\r\n2. Use the new API to find the type of the partition column in `JdbcInputFormat` since information is not propagated correctly to `LIST_COLUMN_TYPES` and leads to IOBE.\r\n3. Some refactoring in `GenericJdbcDatabaseAccessor` to avoid duplicate code with the introduction of the new API.\r\n4. Add test reproducing the IOBE problem, and tests for the new API. \r\n5. Adapt existing accessor,Jdbc format tests based on the changes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nSolves the IOBE problem described in HIVE-26350\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n```\r\nmvn test -pl itests/qtest -Pitests -Dtest=TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver -Dqfile=jdbc_partition_table_pruned_pcolumn.q,external_jdbc_table_partition.q,external_jdbc_table_typeconversion.q\r\nmvn test -pl jdbc-handler -Dtest=TestJdbcInputFormat,TestGenericJdbcDatabaseAccessor\r\n```",

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute\r\n  2. Ensure that you have created an issue on the Hive project JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HIVE/summary\r\n  3. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: \r\n  4. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP]HIVE-XXXXX:  Your PR title ...'.\r\n  5. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  6. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  7. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIntroduce another connection pool for DataNucleus' secondary connection factory\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe now use the same connection pool for primary and secondary connection factory. It can possibly cause connection starvation when DataNucleus try to acquire a lock for schema validation or value generation but there is no available connection in the pool.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description, screenshot and/or a reproducable example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Hive versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nRunning Impala test suites with pool size = 1 and all tests can pass",

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute\r\n  2. Ensure that you have created an issue on the Hive project JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HIVE/summary\r\n  3. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: \r\n  4. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP]HIVE-XXXXX:  Your PR title ...'.\r\n  5. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  6. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  7. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAssigning NO_TXN operation for table in global locks for scheduled queries.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNO_TXN operation type has to be assigned while acquiring locks for the table in global locks because this will not add records to COMPLETED_TXN_COMPONENTS table. Currently the record introduced by this lock had writeId as NULL. There was a situation which lead to large number of records in COMPLETED_TXN_COMPONENTS table because these records had writeId as NULL which weren't deleted by AcidHouseKeeperService/Cleaner and this subsequently lead to OOM errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description, screenshot and/or a reproducable example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Hive versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit test",

In that case, the variable `ci` has a null value but as there is an Exception, the method doesn't exit the method at the `if (ci==null)` null check, and the error handling part assumes ci has a value (based on the previous null check). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a new test in `TestWorker` called `testFindNextCompactThrowsTException`\r\n\r\n",

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute\r\n  2. Ensure that you have created an issue on the Hive project JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HIVE/summary\r\n  3. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: \r\n  4. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP]HIVE-XXXXX:  Your PR title ...'.\r\n  5. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  6. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  7. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nset datanucleus.valuegeneration.transactionAttribute to \"EXISTING\"\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe saw some \"Connection is not available\" errors when there are lots of add_partitions requests in the same time. The root cause is all threads are waiting for a new connection and no one can proceed before timeout. Therefore, it is best to use only single connection at a time for a thread.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description, screenshot and/or a reproducable example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Hive versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting TestAddPartitions",

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute\r\n  2. Ensure that you have created an issue on the Hive project JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HIVE/summary\r\n  3. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: \r\n  4. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP]HIVE-XXXXX:  Your PR title ...'.\r\n  5. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  6. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  7. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDuring ORC reader creation use the split info instead of file schema to decide if it is an original file or fully ACID file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix issue related to query based compaction. Query based compaction creates an external table pointing to the location of  a ACID table. This causes the queries to take the full ACID path instead of external (original) file path even though the split is generated as external table.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test\r\n",

        "body": "We currently use Stack as part of the generic node walking library. Stack should not be used for this since its inheritance from Vector incurs superfluous synchronization overhead. ArrayStack is implemented to replace Stack.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR replaces Stack with ArrayStack, which is a non-sychronized version of Stack, for faster performance.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nArrayStack has a same API with Stack, but without synchronized keyword. It uses an internal ArrayList to keep elements.\r\n * All Stack<Node> method parameters were replaced with ArrayStack<Node>.\r\n * pop(), push(Object), peek(), get(int) methods work exactly same with Stack. Their callers don't need to be changed.\r\n * indexOf(Object) is not implemented. It's used by only one caller and indexOf(Object) method was moved into that caller.\r\n * empty() method was replaced by isEmpty() method, which is in the Collection interface. Its callers were changed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIt'll be tested by the integration test server.",

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute\r\n  2. Ensure that you have created an issue on the Hive project JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HIVE/summary\r\n  3. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: \r\n  4. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP]HIVE-XXXXX:  Your PR title ...'.\r\n  5. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  6. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  7. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Extract common parts which collects and appends the sort and delete columns in case of split update and merge.\r\n2. Merge IcebergWriter data and delete file collections.\r\n3. Append the number of writers in the job to the operationId to generate a unique file name for each writer.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Implement merge into iceberg table by reusing split update code parts.\r\n2. A merge with an insert and an update branch has at least two insert IcebergWriters. If the target table is not partitioned no sorting and exchange is required and both FileSink operators wrapping the IcebergWriters are located in the same Reducer and Job.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Merge statements should not throw any exceptions when the target is an iceberg table.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n```\r\nmvn test -Dtest.output.overwrite -DskipSparkTests -Dtest=TestIcebergLlapLocalCliDriver -Dqfile=merge_iceberg_orc.q,merge_iceberg_partitioned_orc.q -pl itests/qtest-iceberg -Piceberg -Pitests\r\n```",

So essentially add APIs that we only anticipate the replication code to use. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is an issue for replication tools where the updates to directory structure, on the target system (where the DDLs are run), changes and is different from the filesystem image created from the source cluster. This causes the replication manager to perform a full replication (with a full fs sync). If the Metastore does not create the directories for DDL statements, then replication manager snapshots are more consistent without any shell directories and easier to compare.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests, thrift build, maven build\r\n",

        "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nEnable constant propagation for merge statments after predicate push down even if CBO succeeded.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCBO can not handle merge statements and enforce constraint call is added after CBO. This case the constant propagator delivered by Hive is called only with the option `ConstantPropagateOption.SHORTCUT` but with this setting the algorithm does not evaluate deterministic functions like `BETWEEN`.\r\nAs a result constraint checks having expressions with constants are also evaluated at execution time only.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. But when submitting a merge statement constraint violations may detected faster.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n```\r\nmvn test -Dtest.output.overwrite -Dtest=TestNegativeLlapCliDriver -Dqfile=check_merge.q -pl itests/qtest -Pitests\r\n```",

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute\r\n  2. Ensure that you have created an issue on the Hive project JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HIVE/summary\r\n  3. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: \r\n  4. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP]HIVE-XXXXX:  Your PR title ...'.\r\n  5. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  6. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  7. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nProvide a way to stop HiveServer2 gracefully,  so that the aready running queries will not be affected \r\nwhen upgrading many HiveServer2 instances in the same cluster. \r\nFor right now, the gracefully stopping is initiated by: bin/hive --service hiveserver2 --graceful_stop\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description, screenshot and/or a reproducable example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Hive versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n1.  added unit test\r\n2. start hs2 locally; invoke bin/hive --service hiveserver2 --graceful_stop\r\nthe graceful_stop command can also take a parameter, that is, the process id of hs2 to be gracefully stopped. \r\nBy default,  the process id is the value persisted in $HIVESERVER2_PID_DIR/hiveserver2.pid when hs2 startup. \r\nThe HIVESERVER2_PID_DIR defaults to HIVE_CONF_DIR.\r\n\r\n",

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute\r\n  2. Ensure that you have created an issue on the Hive project JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HIVE/summary\r\n  3. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: \r\n  4. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP]HIVE-XXXXX:  Your PR title ...'.\r\n  5. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  6. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  7. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is a follow up of HIVE-21456. In our internal testing, we found the following issues and this PR fixes them:\r\n\r\n- Http thread pool name was not getting set in Jetty server\r\n- Found an issue in which PersistenceManager object was not getting cleaned up after the completion of a http request. Fixed it by adding a listener in Jetty's connector. The listener listens for the completion of Http request and then closes the RawStore (a thread local entity). The RawStore, in turn, cleans up PersistenceManager. \r\n- Added jetty's dependency in metastore pom.xml. Earlier this dependency was getting honored from hadoop-common.\r\n- Fixed a unit test  testJDOPersistanceManagerCleanup() in TestHiveMetaStore\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix issues described above\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description, screenshot and/or a reproducable example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Hive versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nFixed an existing test i.e testJDOPersistanceManagerCleanup. The failure in the test was unrelated to thrift over http patch. After the test is fixed, it was failing for HiveMetaStore in HTTP mode. This patch address that",
