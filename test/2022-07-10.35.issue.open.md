# [\#35 Issue](https://github.com/mattduck/gh2md/issues/35) `open`: download images to git

currently, images have no special handling
gh2md simply uses the original image source

ideally, the user can enable image scraping

* download the images to git
* rewrite the image urls to local paths

also allow special handling of "large" images

* dont download, keep original url (cache the url somewhere to avoid re-downloading)
* compress large JPEGs
* reduce large GIFs to the first frame image
* reduce large video files to a thumbnail image
