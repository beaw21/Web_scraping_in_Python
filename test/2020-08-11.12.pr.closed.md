I try to remove timestamp in github actions and found two problem:
1. AttributeError: 'RateLimit' object has no attribute 'rate'
```console
[user@hostname]$ gh2md mattduck/gh2md issues.md -t 259fb4...
...
...
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/yangjincai/.local/bin/gh2md", line 8, in <module>
    sys.exit(main())
  File "/home/yangjincai/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gh2md/gh2md.py", line 50, in main
    include_closed_issues=args.include_closed_issues,
  File "/home/yangjincai/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gh2md/gh2md.py", line 146, in fetch_repo_and_export_to_markdown
    print_rate_limit(github_api)
  File "/home/yangjincai/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gh2md/gh2md.py", line 306, in print_rate_limit
    print("Github API rate limit: {}".format(limit.rate.raw_data))
AttributeError: 'RateLimit' object has no attribute 'rate'
```
2. need to add `gh2md -I` in Github Actions.

I create this PR for testing, but the Github Actions don't run ......

it works in my private repo. 

hope this info is helpful. @mattduck

@0ut0fcontrol thanks a lot! I've just published a new release that includes your fix for the rate limit AttributeError. Looks like it started occurring 12 days ago. The builds are passing again now :+1: 

I'm gonna close this PR - it didn't make sense for me to merge it as the actions file for this repo should probably still just do `pip install gh2md`.
