# [\#24 Issue](https://github.com/mattduck/gh2md/issues/24) `open`: Support `since` parameter

You're forced to retrieve issues from the begin of time right now - it'd be useful to support `since`.

This exists on issues, but I couldn't see it for PRs when I looked quickly. So may need to be issues-only
