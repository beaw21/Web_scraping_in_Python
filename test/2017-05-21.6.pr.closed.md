tox is not pinned to a specific version.

I'm pinning it to the latest version **2.7.0** for now.

### Changelog
> 
>### 2.7.0

>-----

>- p450: Stop after the first installdeps and first testenv create hooks
>  succeed. This changes the default behaviour of `tox_testenv_create`
>  and `tox_testenv_install_deps` to not execute other registered hooks when
>  the first hook returns a result that is not `None`.
>  Thanks Anthony Sottile (asottile).

>- 271 and 464: Improve environment information for users.

>  New command line parameter: `-a` show **all** defined environments -
>  not just the ones defined in (or generated from) envlist.

>  New verbosity settings for `-l` and `-a`: show user defined descriptions
>  of the environments. This also works for generated environments from factors
>  by concatenating factor descriptions into a complete description.

>  Note that for backwards compatibility with scripts using the output of `-l`
>  it&#39;s output remains unchanged.

>  Thanks Gábor Bernát (gaborbernat).

>- 464: Fix incorrect egg-info location for modified package_dir in setup.py.
>  Thanks Selim Belhaouane (selimb).

>- 431: Add &#39;LANGUAGE&#39; to default passed environment variables.
>  Thanks Paweł Adamczak (pawalad).

>- 455: Add a Vagrantfile with a customized Arch Linux box for local testing.
>  Thanks Oliver Bestwalter (obestwalter).

>- 454: Revert 407, empty commands is not treated as an error.
>  Thanks Anthony Sottile (asottile).

>- 446: (infrastructure) Travis CI tests for tox now also run on OS X now.
>  Thanks Jason R. Coombs (jaraco).



>### 2.6.0

>-----

>- add &quot;alwayscopy&quot; config option to instruct virtualenv to always copy
>  files instead of symlinking. Thanks Igor Duarte Cardoso (igordcard).

>- pass setenv variables to setup.py during a usedevelop install.
>  Thanks Eli Collins (eli-collins).

>- replace all references to testrun.org with readthedocs ones.
>  Thanks Oliver Bestwalter (obestwalter).

>- fix 323 by avoiding virtualenv14 is not used on py32
>  (although we don&#39;t officially support py32).
>  Thanks Jason R. Coombs (jaraco).

>- add Python 3.6 to envlist and CI.
>  Thanks Andrii Soldatenko (andriisoldatenko).

>- fix glob resolution from TOX_TESTENV_PASSENV env variable
>  Thanks Allan Feldman (a-feld).



>### 2.5.0

>-----

>- slightly backward incompatible: fix issue310: the {posargs} substitution
>  now properly preserves the tox command line positional arguments. Positional
>  arguments with spaces are now properly handled.
>  NOTE: if your tox invocation previously used extra quoting for positional arguments to
>  work around issue310, you need to remove the quoting. Example:
>  tox -- &quot;&#39;some string&#39;&quot;   has to now be written simply as
>  tox -- &quot;some string&quot;
>  thanks holger krekel.  You can set ``minversion = 2.5.0`` in the ``[tox]``
>  section of ``tox.ini`` to make sure people using your tox.ini use the correct version.

>- fix 359: add COMSPEC to default passenv on windows.  Thanks
>  anthrotype.

>- add support for py36 and py37 and add py36-dev and py37(nightly) to
>  travis builds of tox. Thanks John Vandenberg.

>- fix 348: add py2 and py3 as default environments pointing to
>  &quot;python2&quot; and &quot;python3&quot; basepython executables.  Also fix 347 by
>  updating the list of default envs in the tox basic example.
>  Thanks Tobias McNulty.

>- make &quot;-h&quot; and &quot;--help-ini&quot; options work even if there is no tox.ini,
>  thanks holger krekel.

>- add {:} substitution, which is replaced with os-specific path
>  separator, thanks Lukasz Rogalski.

>- fix 305: ``downloadcache`` test env config is now ignored as pip-8
>  does caching by default. Thanks holger krekel.

>- output from install command in verbose (-vv) mode is now printed to console instead of
>  being redirected to file, thanks Lukasz Rogalski

>- fix 399.  Make sure {envtmpdir} is created if it doesn&#39;t exist at the
>  start of a testenvironment run. Thanks Manuel Jacob.

>- fix 316: Lack of commands key in ini file is now treated as an error.
>  Reported virtualenv status is &#39;nothing to do&#39; instead of &#39;commands
>  succeeded&#39;, with relevant error message displayed. Thanks Lukasz Rogalski.



>### 2.4.1

>-----

>- fix issue380: properly perform substitution again. Thanks Ian
>  Cordasco.



>### 2.4.0

>-----

>- remove PYTHONPATH from environment during the install phase because a
>  tox-run should not have hidden dependencies and the test commands will also
>  not see a PYTHONPATH.  If this causes unforeseen problems it may be
>  reverted in a bugfix release.  Thanks Jason R. Coombs.

>- fix issue352: prevent a configuration where envdir==toxinidir and
>  refine docs to warn people about changing &quot;envdir&quot;. Thanks Oliver Bestwalter and holger krekel.

>- fix issue375, fix issue330: warn against tox-setup.py integration as
>  &quot;setup.py test&quot; should really just test with the current interpreter. Thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt.

>- fix issue302: allow cross-testenv substitution where we substitute
>  with ``{x,y}`` generative syntax.  Thanks Andrew Pashkin.

>- fix issue212: allow escaping curly brace chars &quot;\{&quot; and &quot;\}&quot; if you need the
>  chars &quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot; to appear in your commands or other ini values.
>  Thanks John Vandenberg.

>- addresses issue66: add --workdir option to override where tox stores its &quot;.tox&quot; directory
>  and all of the virtualenv environment.  Thanks Danring.

>- introduce per-venv list_dependencies_command which defaults
>  to &quot;pip freeze&quot; to obtain the list of installed packages.
>  Thanks Ted Shaw, Holger Krekel.

>- close issue66: add documentation to jenkins page on how to avoid
>  &quot;too long shebang&quot; lines when calling pip from tox.  Note that we
>  can not use &quot;python -m pip install X&quot; by default because the latter
>  adds the CWD and pip will think X is installed if it is there.
>  &quot;pip install X&quot; does not do that.

>- new list_dependencies_command to influence how tox determines
>  which dependencies are installed in a testenv.

>- (experimental) New feature: When a search for a config file fails, tox tries loading
>  setup.cfg with a section prefix of &quot;tox&quot;.

>- fix issue275: Introduce hooks ``tox_runtest_pre``` and
>  ``tox_runtest_post`` which run before and after the tests of a venv,
>  respectively. Thanks to Matthew Schinckel and itxaka serrano.

>- fix issue317: evaluate minversion before tox config is parsed completely.
>  Thanks Sachi King for the PR.

>- added the &quot;extras&quot; environment option to specify the extras to use when doing the
>  sdist or develop install. Contributed by Alex Grönholm.

>- use pytest-catchlog instead of pytest-capturelog (latter is not
>  maintained, uses deprecated pytest API)



>### 2.3.2

>-----

>- fix issue314: fix command invocation with .py scripts on windows.

>- fix issue279: allow cross-section substitution when the value contains
>  posargs. Thanks Sachi King for the PR.



>### 2.3.1

>-----

>- fix issue294: re-allow cross-section substitution for setenv.



>### 2.3.0

>-----

>- DEPRECATE use of &quot;indexservers&quot; in tox.ini.  It complicates
>  the internal code and it is recommended to rather use the
>  devpi system for managing indexes for pip.

>- fix issue285: make setenv processing fully lazy to fix regressions
>  of tox-2.2.X and so that we can now have testenv attributes like
>  &quot;basepython&quot; depend on environment variables that are set in
>  a setenv section. Thanks Nelfin for some tests and initial
>  work on a PR.

>- allow &quot;&quot; in commands.  This is slightly incompatible with commands
>  sections that used a comment after a &quot;\&quot; line continuation.
>  Thanks David Stanek for the PR.

>- fix issue289: fix build_sphinx target, thanks Barry Warsaw.

>- fix issue252: allow environment names with special characters.
>  Thanks Julien Castets for initial PR and patience.

>- introduce experimental tox_testenv_create(venv, action) and
>  tox_testenv_install_deps(venv, action) hooks to allow
>  plugins to do additional work on creation or installing
>  deps.  These hooks are experimental mainly because of
>  the involved &quot;venv&quot; and session objects whose current public
>  API is not fully guranteed.

>- internal: push some optional object creation into tests because
>  tox core doesn&#39;t need it.



>### 2.2.1

>-----

>- fix bug where {envdir} substitution could not be used in setenv
>  if that env value is then used in {basepython}. Thanks Florian Bruhin.



>### 2.2.0

>-----

>- fix issue265 and add LD_LIBRARY_PATH to passenv on linux by default
>  because otherwise the python interpreter might not start up in
>  certain configurations (redhat software collections).  Thanks David Riddle.

>- fix issue246: fix regression in config parsing by reordering
>  such that {envbindir} can be used again in tox.ini. Thanks Olli Walsh.

>- fix issue99: the {env:...} substitution now properly uses environment
>  settings from the ``setenv`` section. Thanks Itxaka Serrano.

>- fix issue281: make --force-dep work when urls are present in
>  dependency configs.  Thanks Glyph Lefkowitz for reporting.

>- fix issue174: add new ``ignore_outcome`` testenv attribute which
>  can be set to True in which case it will produce a warning instead
>  of an error on a failed testenv command outcome.
>  Thanks Rebecka Gulliksson for the PR.

>- fix issue280: properly skip missing interpreter if
>  {envsitepackagesdir} is present in commands. Thanks BB:ceridwenv




>### 2.1.1

>----------

>- fix platform skipping for detox

>- report skipped platforms as skips in the summary



>### 2.1.0

>----------

>- fix issue258, fix issue248, fix issue253: for non-test commands
>  (installation, venv creation) we pass in the full invocation environment.

>- remove experimental --set-home option which was hardly used and
>  hackily implemented (if people want home-directory isolation we should
>  figure out a better way to do it, possibly through a plugin)

>- fix issue259: passenv is now a line-list which allows to intersperse
>  comments.  Thanks stefano-m.

>- allow envlist to be a multi-line list, to intersperse comments
>  and have long envlist settings split more naturally.  Thanks Andre Caron.

>- introduce a TOX_TESTENV_PASSENV setting which is honored
>  when constructing the set of environment variables for test environments.
>  Thanks Marc Abramowitz for pushing in this direction.




>### 2.0.2

>----------

>- fix issue247: tox now passes the LANG variable from the tox invocation
>  environment to the test environment by default.

>- add SYSTEMDRIVE into default passenv on windows to allow pip6 to work.
>  Thanks Michael Krause.




>### 2.0.1

>-----------

>- fix wheel packaging to properly require argparse on py26.



>### 2.0.0

>-----------

>- (new) introduce environment variable isolation:
>  tox now only passes the PATH and PIP_INDEX_URL variable from the tox
>  invocation environment to the test environment and on Windows
>  also ``SYSTEMROOT``, ``PATHEXT``, ``TEMP`` and ``TMP`` whereas
>  on unix additionally ``TMPDIR`` is passed.  If you need to pass
>  through further environment variables you can use the new ``passenv`` setting,
>  a space-separated list of environment variable names.  Each name
>  can make use of fnmatch-style glob patterns.  All environment
>  variables which exist in the tox-invocation environment will be copied
>  to the test environment.

>- a new ``--help-ini`` option shows all possible testenv settings and
>  their defaults.

>- (new) introduce a way to specify on which platform a testenvironment is to
>  execute: the new per-venv &quot;platform&quot; setting allows to specify
>  a regular expression which is matched against sys.platform.
>  If platform is set and doesn&#39;t match the platform spec in the test
>  environment the test environment is ignored, no setup or tests are attempted.

>- (new) add per-venv &quot;ignore_errors&quot; setting, which defaults to False.
>   If ``True``, a non-zero exit code from one command will be ignored and
>   further commands will be executed (which was the default behavior in tox &lt;
>   2.0).  If ``False`` (the default), then a non-zero exit code from one command
>   will abort execution of commands for that environment.

>- show and store in json the version dependency information for each venv

>- remove the long-deprecated &quot;distribute&quot; option as it has no effect these days.

>- fix issue233: avoid hanging with tox-setuptools integration example. Thanks simonb.

>- fix issue120: allow substitution for the commands section.  Thanks
>  Volodymyr Vitvitski.

>- fix issue235: fix AttributeError with --installpkg.  Thanks
>  Volodymyr Vitvitski.

>- tox has now somewhat pep8 clean code, thanks to Volodymyr Vitvitski.

>- fix issue240: allow to specify empty argument list without it being
>  rewritten to &quot;.&quot;.  Thanks Daniel Hahler.

>- introduce experimental (not much documented yet) plugin system
>  based on pytest&#39;s externalized &quot;pluggy&quot; system.
>  See tox/hookspecs.py for the current hooks.

>- introduce parser.add_testenv_attribute() to register an ini-variable
>  for testenv sections.  Can be used from plugins through the
>  tox_add_option hook.

>- rename internal files -- tox offers no external API except for the
>  experimental plugin hooks, use tox internals at your own risk.

>- DEPRECATE distshare in documentation





>### 1.9.2

>-----------

>- backout ability that --force-dep substitutes name/versions in
>  requirement files due to various issues.
>  This fixes issue228, fixes issue230, fixes issue231
>  which popped up with 1.9.1.



>### 1.9.1

>-----------

>- use a file instead of a pipe for command output in &quot;--result-json&quot;.
>  Fixes some termination issues with python2.6.

>- allow --force-dep to override dependencies in &quot;-r&quot; requirements
>  files.  Thanks Sontek for the PR.

>- fix issue227: use &quot;-m virtualenv&quot; instead of &quot;-mvirtualenv&quot; to make
>  it work with pyrun.  Thanks Marc-Andre Lemburg.




>### 1.9.0

>-----------

>- fix issue193: Remove ``--pre`` from the default ``install_command``; by
>  default tox will now only install final releases from PyPI for unpinned
>  dependencies. Use ``pip_pre = true`` in a testenv or the ``--pre``
>  command-line option to restore the previous behavior.

>- fix issue199: fill resultlog structure ahead of virtualenv creation

>- refine determination if we run from Jenkins, thanks Borge Lanes.

>- echo output to stdout when ``--report-json`` is used

>- fix issue11: add a ``skip_install`` per-testenv setting which
>  prevents the installation of a package. Thanks Julian Krause.

>- fix issue124: ignore command exit codes; when a command has a &quot;-&quot; prefix,
>  tox will ignore the exit code of that command

>- fix issue198: fix broken envlist settings, e.g. {py26,py27}{-lint,}

>- fix issue191: lessen factor-use checks




>### 1.8.1

>-----------

>- fix issue190: allow setenv to be empty.

>- allow escaping curly braces with &quot;\&quot;.  Thanks Marc Abramowitz for the PR.

>- allow &quot;.&quot; names in environment names such that &quot;py27-django1.7&quot; is a
>  valid environment name.  Thanks Alex Gaynor and Alex Schepanovski.

>- report subprocess exit code when execution fails.  Thanks Marius
>  Gedminas.



>### 1.8.0

>-----------

>- new multi-dimensional configuration support.  Many thanks to
>  Alexander Schepanovski for the complete PR with docs.
>  And to Mike Bayer and others for testing and feedback.

>- fix issue148: remove &quot;__PYVENV_LAUNCHER__&quot; from os.environ when starting
>  subprocesses. Thanks Steven Myint.

>- fix issue152: set VIRTUAL_ENV when running test commands,
>  thanks Florian Ludwig.

>- better report if we can&#39;t get version_info from an interpreter
>  executable. Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.




>### 1.7.2

>-----------

>- fix issue150: parse {posargs} more like we used to do it pre 1.7.0.
>  The 1.7.0 behaviour broke a lot of OpenStack projects.
>  See PR85 and the issue discussions for (far) more details, hopefully
>  resulting in a more refined behaviour in the 1.8 series.
>  And thanks to Clark Boylan for the PR.

>- fix issue59: add a config variable ``skip-missing-interpreters`` as well as
>  command line option ``--skip-missing-interpreters`` which won&#39;t fail the
>  build if Python interpreters listed in tox.ini are missing.  Thanks
>  Alexandre Conrad for PR104.

>- fix issue164: better traceback info in case of failing test commands.
>  Thanks Marc Abramowitz for PR92.

>- support optional env variable substitution, thanks Morgan Fainberg
>  for PR86.

>- limit python hashseed to 1024 on Windows to prevent possible
>  memory errors.  Thanks March Schlaich for the PR90.



>### 1.7.1

>---------

>- fix issue162: don&#39;t list python 2.5 as compatibiliy/supported

>- fix issue158 and fix issue155: windows/virtualenv properly works now:
>  call virtualenv through &quot;python -m virtualenv&quot; with the same
>  interpreter which invoked tox.  Thanks Chris Withers, Ionel Maries Cristian.



>### 1.7.0

>---------

>- don&#39;t lookup &quot;pip-script&quot; anymore but rather just &quot;pip&quot; on windows
>  as this is a pip implementation detail and changed with pip-1.5.
>  It might mean that tox-1.7 is not able to install a different pip
>  version into a virtualenv anymore.

>- drop Python2.5 compatibility because it became too hard due
>  to the setuptools-2.0 dropping support.  tox now has no
>  support for creating python2.5 based environments anymore
>  and all internal special-handling has been removed.

>- merged PR81: new option --force-dep which allows to
>  override tox.ini specified dependencies in setuptools-style.
>  For example &quot;--force-dep &#39;django&lt;1.6&#39;&quot; will make sure
>  that any environment using &quot;django&quot; as a dependency will
>  get the latest 1.5 release.  Thanks Bruno Oliveria for
>  the complete PR.

>- merged PR125: tox now sets &quot;PYTHONHASHSEED&quot; to a random value
>  and offers a &quot;--hashseed&quot; option to repeat a test run with a specific seed.
>  You can also use --hashsheed=noset to instruct tox to leave the value
>  alone.  Thanks Chris Jerdonek for all the work behind this.

>- fix issue132: removing zip_safe setting (so it defaults to false)
>  to allow installation of tox
>  via easy_install/eggs.  Thanks Jenisys.

>- fix issue126: depend on virtualenv&gt;=1.11.2 so that we can rely
>  (hopefully) on a pip version which supports --pre. (tox by default
>  uses to --pre).  also merged in PR84 so that we now call &quot;virtualenv&quot;
>  directly instead of looking up interpreters.  Thanks Ionel Maries Cristian.
>  This also fixes issue140.

>- fix issue130: you can now set install_command=easy_install {opts} {packages}
>  and expect it to work for repeated tox runs (previously it only worked
>  when always recreating).  Thanks jenisys for precise reporting.

>- fix issue129: tox now uses Popen(..., universal_newlines=True) to force
>  creation of unicode stdout/stderr streams.  fixes a problem on specific
>  platform configs when creating virtualenvs with Python3.3. Thanks
>  Jorgen Schäfer or investigation and solution sketch.

>- fix issue128: enable full substitution in install_command,
>  thanks for the PR to Ronald Evers

>- rework and simplify &quot;commands&quot; parsing and in particular posargs
>  substitutions to avoid various win32/posix related quoting issues.

>- make sure that the --installpkg option trumps any usedevelop settings
>  in tox.ini or

>- introduce --no-network to tox&#39;s own test suite to skip tests
>  requiring networks

>- introduce --sitepackages to force sitepackages=True in all
>  environments.

>- fix issue105 -- don&#39;t depend on an existing HOME directory from tox tests.



>### 1.6.1

>-----

>- fix issue119: {envsitepackagesdir} is now correctly computed and has
>  a better test to prevent regression.

>- fix issue116: make 1.6 introduced behaviour of changing to a
>  per-env HOME directory during install activities dependent
>  on &quot;--set-home&quot; for now.  Should re-establish the old behaviour
>  when no option is given.

>- fix issue118: correctly have two tests use realpath(). Thanks Barry
>  Warsaw.

>- fix test runs on environments without a home directory
>  (in this case we use toxinidir as the homedir)

>- fix issue117: python2.5 fix: don&#39;t use ``--insecure`` option because
>  its very existence depends on presence of &quot;ssl&quot;.  If you
>  want to support python2.5/pip1.3.1 based test environments you need
>  to install ssl and/or use PIP_INSECURE=1 through ``setenv``. section.

>- fix issue102: change to {toxinidir} when installing dependencies.
>  this allows to use relative path like in &quot;-rrequirements.txt&quot;.



>### 1.6.0

>-----------------

>- fix issue35: add new EXPERIMENTAL &quot;install_command&quot; testenv-option to
>  configure the installation command with options for dep/pkg install.
>  Thanks Carl Meyer for the PR and docs.

>- fix issue91: python2.5 support by vendoring the virtualenv-1.9.1
>  script and forcing pip&lt;1.4. Also the default [py25] environment
>  modifies the default installer_command (new config option)
>  to use pip without the &quot;--pre&quot; option which was introduced
>  with pip-1.4 and is now required if you want to install non-stable
>  releases.  (tox defaults to install with &quot;--pre&quot; everywhere).

>- during installation of dependencies HOME is now set to a pseudo
>  location ({envtmpdir}/pseudo-home).  If an index url was specified
>  a .pydistutils.cfg file will be written with an index_url setting
>  so that packages defining ``setup_requires`` dependencies will not
>  silently use your HOME-directory settings or https://pypi.python.org.

>- fix issue1: empty setup files are properly detected, thanks Anthon van
>  der Neuth

>- remove toxbootstrap.py for now because it is broken.

>- fix issue109 and fix issue111: multiple &quot;-e&quot; options are now combined
>  (previously the last one would win). Thanks Anthon van der Neut.

>- add --result-json option to write out detailed per-venv information
>  into a json report file to be used by upstream tools.

>- add new config options ``usedevelop`` and ``skipsdist`` as well as a
>  command line option ``--develop`` to install the package-under-test in develop mode.
>  thanks Monty Tailor for the PR.

>- always unset PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTE because newer setuptools doesn&#39;t like it

>- if a HOMEDIR cannot be determined, use the toxinidir.

>- refactor interpreter information detection to live in new
>  tox/interpreters.py file, tests in tests/test_interpreters.py.



>### 1.5.0

>-----------------

>- fix issue104: use setuptools by default, instead of distribute,
>  now that setuptools has distribute merged.

>- make sure test commands are searched first in the virtualenv

>- re-fix issue2 - add whitelist_externals to be used in ``[testenv*]``
>  sections, allowing to avoid warnings for commands such as ``make``,
>  used from the commands value.

>- fix issue97 - allow substitutions to reference from other sections
>  (thanks Krisztian Fekete)

>- fix issue92 - fix {envsitepackagesdir} to actually work again

>- show (test) command that is being executed, thanks
>  Lukasz Balcerzak

>- re-license tox to MIT license

>- depend on virtualenv-1.9.1

>- rename README.txt to README.rst to make bitbucket happier




>### 1.4.3

>-----------------

>- use pip-script.py instead of pip.exe on win32 to avoid the lock exe
>  file on execution issue (thanks Philip Thiem)

>- introduce -l|--listenv option to list configured environments
>  (thanks  Lukasz Balcerzak)

>- fix downloadcache determination to work according to docs: Only
>  make pip use a download cache if PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE or a
>  downloadcache=PATH testenv setting is present. (The ENV setting
>  takes precedence)

>- fix issue84 - pypy on windows creates a bin not a scripts venv directory
>  (thanks Lukasz Balcerzak)

>- experimentally introduce --installpkg=PATH option to install a package
>  rather than create/install an sdist package.  This will still require
>  and use tox.ini and tests from the current working dir (and not from the
>  remote package).

>- substitute {envsitepackagesdir} with the package installation
>  directory (closes 72) (thanks g2p)

>- issue 70 remove PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE workaround now that
>  virtualenv behaves properly (thanks g2p)

>- merged tox-quickstart command, contributed by Marc Abramowitz, which
>  generates a default tox.ini after asking a few questions

>- fix 48 - win32 detection of pypy and other interpreters that are on PATH
>  (thanks Gustavo Picon)

>- fix grouping of index servers, it is now done by name instead of
>  indexserver url, allowing to use it to separate dependencies
>  into groups even if using the same default indexserver.

>- look for &quot;tox.ini&quot; files in parent dirs of current dir (closes 34)

>- the &quot;py&quot; environment now by default uses the current interpreter
>  (sys.executable) make tox&#39; own setup.py test execute tests with it
>  (closes 46)

>- change tests to not rely on os.path.expanduser (closes 60),
>  also make mock session return args[1:] for more precise checking (closes 61)
>  thanks to Barry Warsaw for both.



>### 1.4.2

>-----------------

>- fix some tests which fail if /tmp is a symlink to some other place
>- &quot;python setup.py test&quot; now runs tox tests via tox :)
>  also added an example on how to do it for your project.



>### 1.4.1

>-----------------

>- fix issue41 better quoting on windows - you can now use &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; in
>  deps specifications, thanks Chris Withers for reporting



>### 1.4

>-----------------

>- fix issue26 - no warnings on absolute or relative specified paths for commands
>- fix issue33 - commentchars are ignored in key-value settings allowing
>  for specifying commands like: python -c &quot;import sys ; print sys&quot;
>  which would formerly raise irritating errors because the &quot;;&quot;
>  was considered a comment
>- tweak and improve reporting
>- refactor reporting and virtualenv manipulation
>  to be more accessible from 3rd party tools
>- support value substitution from other sections
>  with the {[section]key} syntax
>- fix issue29 - correctly point to pytest explanation
>  for importing modules fully qualified
>- fix issue32 - use --system-site-packages and don&#39;t pass --no-site-packages
>- add python3.3 to the default env list, so early adopters can test
>- drop python2.4 support (you can still have your tests run on
>- fix the links/checkout howtos in the docs
>  python-2.4, just tox itself requires 2.5 or higher.



>### 1.3

>-----------------

>- fix: allow to specify wildcard filesystem paths when
>  specifying dependencies such that tox searches for
>  the highest version

>- fix issue issue21: clear PIP_REQUIRES_VIRTUALENV which avoids
>  pip installing to the wrong environment, thanks to bb&#39;s streeter

>- make the install step honour a testenv&#39;s setenv setting
>  (thanks Ralf Schmitt)




>### 1.2

>-----------------

>- remove the virtualenv.py that was distributed with tox and depend
>  on &gt;=virtualenv-1.6.4 (possible now since the latter fixes a few bugs
>  that the inlining tried to work around)
>- fix issue10: work around UnicodeDecodeError when invoking pip (thanks
>  Marc Abramowitz)
>- fix a problem with parsing {posargs} in tox commands (spotted by goodwill)
>- fix the warning check for commands to be installed in testenvironment
>  (thanks Michael Foord for reporting)



>### 1.1

>-----------------

>- fix issue5 - don&#39;t require argparse for python versions that have it
>- fix issue6 - recreate virtualenv if installing dependencies failed
>- fix issue3 - fix example on frontpage
>- fix issue2 - warn if a test command does not come from the test
>  environment
>- fixed/enhanced: except for initial install always call &quot;-U
>  --no-deps&quot; for installing the sdist package to ensure that a package
>  gets upgraded even if its version number did not change. (reported on
>  TIP mailing list and IRC)
>- inline virtualenv.py (1.6.1) script to avoid a number of issues,
>  particularly failing to install python3 environments from a python2
>  virtualenv installation.
>- rework and enhance docs for display on readthedocs.org



>### 1.0

>-----------------

>- move repository and toxbootstrap links to http://bitbucket.org/hpk42/tox
>- fix issue7: introduce a &quot;minversion&quot; directive such that tox
>  bails out if it does not have the correct version.
>- fix issue24: introduce a way to set environment variables for
>  for test commands (thanks Chris Rose)
>- fix issue22: require virtualenv-1.6.1, obsoleting virtualenv5 (thanks Jannis Leidel)
>  and making things work with pypy-1.5 and python3 more seamlessly
>- toxbootstrap.py (used by jenkins build slaves) now follows the latest release of virtualenv
>- fix issue20: document format of URLs for specifying dependencies
>- fix issue19: substitute Hudson for Jenkins everywhere following the renaming
>  of the project.  NOTE: if you used the special [tox:hudson]
>  section it will now need to be named [tox:jenkins].
>- fix issue 23 / apply some ReST fixes
>- change the positional argument specifier to use {posargs:} syntax and
>  fix issues 15 and 10 by refining the argument parsing method (Chris Rose)
>- remove use of inipkg lazy importing logic -
>  the namespace/imports are anyway very small with tox.
>- fix a fspath related assertion to work with debian installs which uses
>  symlinks
>- show path of the underlying virtualenv invocation and bootstrap
>  virtualenv.py into a working subdir
>- added a CONTRIBUTORS file



>### 0.9

>-----------------

>- fix pip-installation mixups by always unsetting PIP_RESPECT_VIRTUALENV
>  (thanks Armin Ronacher)
>- issue1: Add a toxbootstrap.py script for tox, thanks to Sridhar
>  Ratnakumar
>- added support for working with different and multiple PyPI indexservers.
>- new option: -r|--recreate to force recreation of virtualenv
>- depend on py&gt;=1.4.0 which does not contain or install the py.test
>  anymore which is now a separate distribution &quot;pytest&quot;.
>- show logfile content if there is an error (makes CI output
>  more readable)



>### 0.8

>-----------------

>- work around a virtualenv limitation which crashes if
>  PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE is set.
>- run pip/easy installs from the environment log directory, avoids
>  naming clashes between env names and dependencies (thanks ronny)
>- require a more recent version of py lib
>- refactor and refine config detection to work from a single file
>  and to detect the case where a python installation overwrote
>  an old one and resulted in a new executable. This invalidates
>  the existing virtualenvironment now.
>- change all internal source to strip trailing whitespaces



>### 0.7

>-----------------

>- use virtualenv5 (my own fork of virtualenv3) for now to create python3
>  environments, fixes a couple of issues and makes tox more likely to
>  work with Python3 (on non-windows environments)

>- add ``sitepackages`` option for testenv sections so that environments
>  can be created with access to globals (default is not to have access,
>  i.e. create environments with ``--no-site-packages``.

>- addressing issue4: always prepend venv-path to PATH variable when calling subprocesses

>- fix issue2: exit with proper non-zero return code if there were
>  errors or test failures.

>- added unittest2 examples contributed by Michael Foord

>- only allow &#39;True&#39; or &#39;False&#39; for boolean config values
>  (lowercase / uppercase is irrelevant)

>- recreate virtualenv on changed configurations



>### 0.6

>-----------------

>- fix OSX related bugs that could cause the caller&#39;s environment to get
>  screwed (sorry).  tox was using the same file as virtualenv for tracking
>  the Python executable dependency and there also was confusion wrt links.
>  this should be fixed now.

>- fix long description, thanks Michael Foord



>### 0.5

>-----------------

>- initial release
