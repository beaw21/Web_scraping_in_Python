twine is not pinned to a specific version.

I'm pinning it to the latest version **1.8.1** for now.

### Changelog
> 
>### 1.8.1


>  * Check if a package exists if the URL is one of:

>    - ``https://pypi.python.org/pypi/``
>    - ``https://upload.pypi.org/``
>    - ``https://upload.pypi.io/``

>    This helps people with ``https://upload.pypi.io`` still in their .pypirc
>    file.



>### 1.8.0


>  * :feature:`201` Switch from upload.pypi.io to upload.pypi.org.

>  * :feature:`144` Retrieve configuration from the environment as a default.

>    - Repository URL will default to ``TWINE_REPOSITORY``

>    - Username will default to ``TWINE_USERNAME``

>    - Password will default to ``TWINE_PASSWORD``

>  * :feature:`166` Allow the Repository URL to be provided on the command-line
>    (``--repository-url``) or via an environment variable
>    (``TWINE_REPOSITORY_URL``).

>  * Generate SHA256 digest for all packages by default.

>  * :feature:`171` Generate Blake2b 256 digests for packages *if* ``pyblake2``
>    is installed. Users can use ``python -m pip install twine[with-blake2]``
>    to have ``pyblake2`` installed with Twine.

>  * Stop testing on Python 2.6. 2.6 support will be &quot;best effort&quot; until 2.0.0

>  * Warn users if they receive a 500 error when uploading to \*pypi.python.org



>### 1.7.4


>  * Correct a packaging error.



>### 1.7.3


>  * :bug:`195` Fix uploads to instances of pypiserver using
>    ``--skip-existing``. We were not properly checking the return status code
>    on the response after attempting an upload.

>  * Do not generate traffic to Legacy PyPI unless we&#39;re uploading to it or
>    uploading to Warehouse (e.g., pypi.io). This avoids the attempt to upload
>    a package to the index if we can find it on Legacy PyPI already.



>### 1.7.2


>  * :bug:`189`, :bug:`191` Fix issue where we were checking the existence of
>    packages even if the user didn&#39;t specify ``--skip-existing``.



>### 1.7.1


>  * :bug:`187` Clint was not specified in the wheel metadata as a dependency.



>### 1.7.0


>  * :feature:`142` Support ``--cert`` and ``--client-cert`` command-line flags
>    and config file options for feature parity with pip. This allows users to
>    verify connections to servers other than PyPI (e.g., local package
>    repositories) with different certificates.

>  * :feature:`152` Add progress bar to uploads.

>  * :feature:`162` Allow ``--skip-existing`` to work for 409 status codes.

>  * :feature:`167` Implement retries when the CDN in front of PyPI gives us a
>    5xx error.

>  * :feature:`177` Switch Twine to upload to pypi.io instead of
>    pypi.python.org.

>  * :bug:`186` Allow passwords to have ``%``\ s in them.



>### 1.6.5


>  * :bug:`155` Bump requests-toolbelt version to ensure we avoid
>    ConnectionErrors



>### 1.6.4


>  * :bug:`145` Paths with hyphens in them break the Wheel regular expression.

>  * :bug:`146` Exception while accessing the ``respository`` key when raising
>    a redirect exception.



>### 1.6.3


>  * :bug:`137`, :bug:`140` Uploading signatures was broken due to the pull
>    request that added large file support via ``requests-toolbelt``. This
>    caused a 500 error on PyPI and prevented package and signature upload in
>    twine 1.6.0



>### 1.6.2


>  * :bug:`132` Upload signatures with packages appropriately

>    As part of the refactor for the 1.6.0 release, we were using the wrong
>    name to find the signature file.

>    This also uncovered a bug where if you&#39;re using twine in a situation where
>    ``*`` is not expanded by your shell, we might also miss uploading
>    signatures to PyPI. Both were fixed as part of this.



>### 1.6.1


>  * :bug:`130` Fix signing support for uploads



>### 1.6.0


>  * :feature:`106` Upload wheels first to PyPI

>  * :feature:`104` Large file support via the ``requests-toolbelt``

>  * :bug:`92` Raise an exception on redirects

>  * :feature:`97` Allow the user to specify the location of their ``.pypirc``

>  * :feature:`115` Add the ``--skip-existing`` flag to ``twine upload`` to
>    allow users to skip releases that already exist on PyPI.

>  * :bug:`114` Warnings triggered by pkginfo searching for ``PKG-INFO`` files
>    should no longer be user visible.

>  * :bug:`116` Work around problems with Windows when using
>    :func:`getpass.getpass`

>  * :bug:`111` Provide more helpful messages if ``.pypirc`` is out of date.

>  * :feature:`8` Support registering new packages with ``twine register``



>### 1.5.0


>  * :bug:`85` Display information about the version of setuptools installed

>  * :bug:`61` Support deprecated pypirc file format

>  * :feature:`29` Support commands not named &quot;gpg&quot; for signing

>  * Add lower-limit to requests dependency



>### 1.4.0


>  * :bug:`28` Prevent ResourceWarning from being shown

>  * :bug:`34` List registered commands in help text

>  * :bug:`32` Use pkg_resources to load registered commands

>  * :bug:`47` Fix issue uploading packages with ``_``\ s in the name

>  * :bug:`26` Add support for uploading Windows installers

>  * :bug:`65` Expand globs and check for existence of dists to upload

>* :feature:`13` Parse ~/.pypirc ourselves and use subprocess instead of the
>  distutils.spawn module.
>* :feature:`6` Switch to a git style dispatching for the commands to enable
>  simpler commands and programmatic invocation.


>### 1.2.2
